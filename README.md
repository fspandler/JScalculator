# JScalculator


I used a table.  My reasoning for it is that I do not want the elements to move out of place. 
I did try for some time to do accomplish everything with divs and changing the display properties.
The page would read whitespace placing spaces in between divs.  The only way I found to fix this was to remove all 
whitespace, but this made the code hard to read.  I am shooting for maximum browser compatibity since I want to put this
on my portfolio for freelance clients to see.  They might not be using recent browsers.
